## How 

By using a user's input and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file; Referring the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide).

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, here is a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.
